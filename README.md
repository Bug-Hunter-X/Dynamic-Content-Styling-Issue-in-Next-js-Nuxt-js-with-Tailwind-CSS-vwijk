## Dynamic Content Styling Issue in Next.js/Nuxt.js with Tailwind CSS

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Tailwind CSS with dynamic content in Next.js or Nuxt.js applications. The problem arises because Tailwind's static analysis during the build process might not capture dynamically generated classes.  This results in missing or incorrect styles for dynamically rendered elements.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problem. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution to address this issue.

**To Reproduce:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
4. Run the Next.js or Nuxt.js development server.
5. Observe the missing or incorrect styles on the dynamically generated content.

**Solution:**

The solution involves using Tailwind's `@apply` directive or a custom `className` prop, depending on how the dynamic content is generated. This ensures that the classes are applied correctly at runtime.
