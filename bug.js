This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js.  The issue arises when dynamically generated content is not properly styled by Tailwind.  For example, if you're using a loop to render list items, the styles may not be applied correctly or may be missing entirely. This is often due to Tailwind's reliance on static analysis during build time, which might not capture dynamically generated classes.
